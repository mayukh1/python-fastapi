# requirement.txt is required for installing the dependencies for running the code
# uvicorn authentication.main:app --reload (Run on 8000)
# POSTGRESQL_HOST = os.getenv("POSTGRESQL_HOST", "localhost") try this on production with the postgres svc name(postgresql instate of localhost because both backend and db service are running via two different pods)

# step 1: build the dockerfile and push the images to quay.io and deploy as a container images
# step 2: build as a deployment config with a build strategy docker push it to image stream and then finally run the application(https://github.com/mayukh1/python-fastapi/blob/main/build-config.sh)
# step 3: buil as a pipeline and trigger
